**The Core Difference between parameter tuning vs hyperparameter tuning** </br>
Parameter Tuning (Model Training): This is the internal process where the model learns from the data. You do not set these manually; the algorithm calculates them.


**Hyperparameter Tuning:** </br> 
This is the external process where you (the human) set configuration values before training begins to control how the model learns.
